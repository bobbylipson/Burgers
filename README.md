# Burgers App

Homework #14

This app uses Node.js, express, handlebars and MySQL to let users create and devour burgers.

Burgers that have been created but not yet devoured show up on the left side and once you devour a burger it moves to the right side. 

Users can create new burgers by typing in the burger name and clicking submit. Now the burger shows on the left side. Once the user clicks 'Devour', the burger will move to the right side. 

Meanwhile, on the back end, all the burgers data; devoured or not, are stored in a database using mySQL workbench named burgers_db.
